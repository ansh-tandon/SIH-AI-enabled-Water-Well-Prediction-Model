# Inspiration
- This project is inspired by the Ministry of Jal Shakti's mission to ensure sustainable water resource management in India. 
- Our team, PixelBytes, from the S.R.M Institute of Science and Technology, is committed to contributing to the Ministry's Clean & Green Technology initiative.
- We aim to leverage the power of AI and data-driven insights to address the critical issue of groundwater management.

## What it does
- Our project focuses on predicting the suitability, depth, discharge, drilling techniques, and groundwater quality for well construction. 
- It utilizes a machine learning model to analyze diverse groundwater-related data, including Lithology, Geophysical logs, Water Levels, Water Quality, and Aquifer Maps.
- The AI model provides valuable insights to make informed decisions about well construction.

## How we built it
- Data Collection and Integration: We gathered diverse groundwater-related data from various sources and integrated and preprocessed these datasets into a unified format for analysis.

- AI Model Development: We trained machine learning models, including Random Forest, to predict well-related parameters. These models were continuously fine-tuned and improved based on 
  new data and user feedback.

- User-Friendly Interface: We developed an intuitive web-based interface with map-based location selection to present AI model predictions in a user-friendly manner.

- Feedback Loop and User Engagement: We implemented a structured feedback mechanism to collect user input on system predictions and usability, ensuring continuous improvement.

- Data Privacy and Security: Robust data privacy and security measures were implemented to protect user information and maintain data integrity.

## Accomplishments we're proud of
- Successfully developed a machine learning model capable of predicting crucial parameters for well construction.
- Created a user-friendly interface that empowers users to make informed decisions regarding well construction.
- Established a feedback loop for user engagement and continuous improvement.
